1. Whenever there are two variable, one is categorical and other is numerical. go for ChiSquare test.

2. Whenever there are two categorical variables, we want to study relationship between those two, go for ChiSquare test.

3. If we have more than 2 samples, we go for ANOVA.

4. If there are only two samples and want to compute mean, go for T-test.
5. If there are only two populations and want to compute variances, go for F-test.

Gender vs game(particular sport)
Game1, Game2, Game3 and Genders are M/F - Chisquare

Compute variance:

for single population - Chisquare
for two population - F test
for more than two population - Anova (for both mean and variance)


compute mean:

Z-test and T-test
